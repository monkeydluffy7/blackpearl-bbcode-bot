## Installation

### Requirements

Install the following dependencies in the listed order. Ensure Everything is added to the environment path.

1. [python], 3.6.0 or newer
2. [rclone], rclone.exe and rclone.config in same path or needed to be added in environment path
3. [mediainfo], mediainfo.exe same path or environment

### Steps

- Edit BOTCONFIG.py Add Your Credentials And Paths
- Install Requirements : `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Add Needed Files to Path : rclone.exe - mediainfo.exe - rclone.config
- Mount Your Drive using rclone : `rclone mount remote:foldername --vfs-cache-mode full s:`
 
  Note : Make Sure U mounted the remote:folder mentioned in config file, You can change `s:` to your mounted drive name (not rclone name)
- Run Bot `python BPBBCODE.py`
- Open Telegram Send `/movie Foldername` or `/tv foldername`

## Working

- Suppose your full path is : `TEAM DRIVE/BOT/MOVIES/DUNE.2021.mkv`
  BOT is your remote folder (folder u configured remote or root folder) 
  And Your Remote name is : `Arthur`
  And If you want to fetch bbcode -
     * Mount `Arthur:BOT`
     * And You need to write : `Arthur:BOT/` in BOTCONFIG.py : `REMOTE_NAME = "Arthur:BOT/"`
     * And When You use command in bot Use : `/movie MOVIES`
           So it loops in `S:/MOVIES/` for MKV/MP4/AVI files
     * If you Are Trying TVSHOW, You must add season folder in command folder
           That is : `TEAM DRIVE/BOT/TVSHOWS/VIGIL.S01/Vigil.S01E01.mkv`
                     `TEAM DRIVE/BOT/TVSHOWS/VIGIL.S01/Vigil.S01E02.mkv`
           And You Request : `/tv TVSHOWS` so that it picks season folder link and size.It only picks First episode for mediainfo,Rest of the episodes got skipped for mediainfo.So Unless there is `E01` its skips..

## Issues
- Working must be trickier for you,But if you have any issues just add, I will fix it..
